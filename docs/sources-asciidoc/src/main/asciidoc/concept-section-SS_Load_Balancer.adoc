The Restcomm Load Balancer is used to balance the load of SIP service requests and responses between nodes in a SIP Server cluster, such as {this-platform} JAIN SLEE or SIP Servlets.
Both {this-platform} servers can be used in conjunction with the Restcomm Load Balancer to increase the performance and availability of SIP services and applications.

In terms of functionality, the Restcomm Load Balancer is a simple stateless proxy server that intelligently forwards SIP session requests and responses between User Agents (UAs) on a Wide Area Network (WAN), and SIP Server nodes, which are almost always located on a Local Area Network (LAN). All SIP requests and responses pass through the Restcomm Load Balancer.

Starting with the 7.0.0.GA release, Restcomm Load Balancer can handle WebSocket requests supporting up to version 13 of the wire protocol - RFC 6455 (version 17 of the draft hybi specification - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-17  ). Restcomm Load Balancer will accept HTTP requests and if the request contains header Sec-WebSocket-Protocol it will upgrade the connection and dispatch the reuqest to a node capable to handle WebSocket requests (a node that has a WebSocket connector).

One major advantage of having WebSocket support for Restcomm Load Balancer is to allow tunneling over HTTP port for SIP traffic and thus bypass proxy and firewall servers that might be blocking SIP traffic.

== Load Balancer: Installing, Configuring andRunning

[[_sslb_binary_sip_load_balancer_preinstall_requirements_and_prerequisites]]
=== Pre-Install Requirements and Prerequisites

.Software Prerequisites
A JAIN SIP HA-enabled application server such as {this-platform}  JAIN SLEE or {this-platform} SIP Servlets is required.::
  Running the Restcomm Load Balancer requires at least two instances of the application server as cluster nodes nodes.
  Therefore, before configuring the Restcomm Load Balancer, we should make sure we've installed a the SIP application server first.
  The {this-platform} Restcomm Load Balancer will work with a SIP Servlets-enabled JBoss Application Server _or_            a JAIN SLEE application server with SIP RA.

[[_sslb_binary_sip_load_balancer_downloading]]
=== Downloading

The load balancer is located in the [path]_sip-balancer_ top-level directory of the {this-platform}  distribution.
You will find the following files in the directory:

Load balancer executable JAR file::
  This is the binary file with all dependencies

Load balancer Configuration Properties file::
  This is the properties files with various settings

[[_sslb_binary_sip_load_balancer_installing]]
=== Installing

The Load balancer executable JAR file can be extracted anywhere in the file system.
It is recommended that the file is placed in the directory containing other JAR executables, so it can be easily located in the future.

[[_sslb_binary_sip_load_balancer_configuring]]

NOTE: The remaining keys and properties in the configuration properties file can be used to tune the JAIN SIP stack, but are not specifically required for load balancing.
To assist with tuning, a comprehensive list of implementing classes for the SIP Stack is available from the http://snad.ncsl.nist.gov/proj/iptel/jain-sip-1.2/javadoc/javax/sip/SipStack.html[Interface
            SIP Stack page on nist.gov] . For a comprehensive list of properties associated with the SIP Stack implementation, refer to http://snad.ncsl.nist.gov/proj/iptel/jain-sip-1.2/javadoc/gov/nist/javax/sip/SipStackImpl.html[Class
            SipStackImpl page on nist.gov] .
+
NOTE: If Restcomm Load Balancer is behind firewall you will need to open all the required ports.
The default ports are: TCP: 2000, 2001, 2080, 5060, 5065, 8000 UDP: 5060, 5065

. Configure logging
+
The Restcomm Load Balancer uses http://logging.apache.org/log4j[Log4J] as a logging mechanism.
You can configure it through the typical log4j xml configuration file and specify the path as follows `-DlogConfigFile=./log4j.xml` . Please refer to Log4J documentation for more information on how to configure the logging.
A shortcut exists if you want to switch between INFO/DEBUG/WARN logging levels.
The JVM option `-DlogLevel=DEBUG` will allow you to switch all loggig categories to the specified log level.


==== Converged Load Balancing

===== Apache HTTP Load Balancer

The {this-platform} Restcomm Load Balancer can work in concert with HTTP load balancers such as `mod_jk` . Whenever an HTTP session is bound to a particular node, an instruction is sent to the Restcomm Load Balancer to direct the SIP calls from the same application session to the same node.

It is sufficient to configure `mod_jk` to work for HTTP in JBoss in order to enable cooperative load balancing. {this-platform}  will read the configuration and will use it without any extra configuration.
You can read more about configuring `mod_jk` with JBoss in your JBoss Application Server documentation.

===== Integrated HTTP Load Balancer

To use the integrated HTTP Load Balancer, no extra configuration is needed.
If a unique `jvmRoute` is specified and enabled in each application server, it will behave exactly as the apache balancer.
If `jvmRoute` is not present, it will use the session ID as a hash value and attempt to create a sticky session.
The integrated balancer can be used together with the apache balancer at the same time.

In addition to the apache behavior, there is a consistent hash balancer algorithm that can be enabled for both HTTP and SIP messages.
For both HTTP and SIP messages, there is a configurable affinity key, which is evaluated and hashed against each unassigned request.
All requests with the same hash value will always be routed to the same application server node.
For example, the SIP affinity key could be the callee user name and the HTTP affinity key could the "`appsession`" HTTP GET parameter of the request.
If the desired behaviour group these requests, we can just make sure the affinity values (user name and GET parameter) are the same.

[[_sslb_binary_sip_load_balancer_testing]]
=== Testing

To test load balancing, the same application must be deployed manually on each node, and two SIP Softphones must be installed.

.Procedure: Testing Load Balancing with Sip Servlets
. Deploy an Application
+
Ensure that for each node, the DAR file location is specified in the [path]_server.xml_ file.
+
Deploy the Location service manually on both nodes.

. Start the "Sender" SIP softphone
+
Start a SIP softphone client with the SIP address of `sip:sender@sip-servlets-com` , listening on port 5055.
The outbound proxy must be specified as the sip-balancer (http://127.0.0.1:5060)

. Start the "Receiver" SIP softphone
+
Start a SIP softphone client with the SIP address of `sip:receiver-failover@sip-servlets-com` , listening on port 5090.

. Initiate two calls from "Sender" SIP softphone
+
Initiate one call from `sip:sender@sip-servlets-com` to `sip:receiver-failover@sip-servlets-com` . Tear down the call once completed.
+
Initiate a second call using the same SIP address, and tear down the call once completed.
Notice that the call is handled by the second node.


.Procedure: Testing Load Balancing with JAIN SLEE and SIP RA
. Deploy SIP RA
. Configure the JAIN SIP HA properties for load balancing according to the JAIN SLEE User Guide
. Deploy a sample application
. Run the sample scenario for the application using the Restcomm Load Balancer

== SIP Load Balancing Basics

All User Agents send SIP messages, such as `INVITE`    and `MESSAGE` , to the same SIP URI (the IP address and port number of the Restcomm Load Balancer on the WAN). The Load Balancer then parses, alters, and forwards those messages to an available node in the cluster.
If the message was sent as a part of an existing SIP session, it will be forwarded to the cluster node which processed that User Agent's original transaction request.

The SIP Server that receives the message acts upon it and sends a response back to the Restcomm Load Balancer.
The Restcomm Load Balancer reparses, alters and forwards the message back to the original User Agent.
This entire proxying and provisioning process is carried out independent of the User Agent, which is only concerned with the SIP service or application it is using.

By using the Load Balancer, SIP traffic is balanced across a pool of available SIP Servers, increasing the overall throughput of the SIP service or application running on either individual nodes of the cluster.
In the case of a {this-platform} server with `</distributed>` capabilities, load balancing advantages are applied across the entire cluster.

The Restcomm Load Balancer is also able to failover requests mid-call from unavailable nodes to available ones, thus increasing the reliability of the SIP service or application.
The Load Balancer increases throughput and reliability by dynamically provisioning SIP service requests and responses across responsive nodes in a cluster.
This enables SIP applications to meet the real-time demand for SIP services.

== HTTP Load Balancing Basics

In addition to the SIP load balancing, there are several options for coordinated or cooperative load balancing with other protocols such as HTTP.

Typically, a JBoss Application Server will use apache HTTP server with mod_jk, mod_proxy, mod_cluster or similar extension installed as an HTTP load balancer.
This apache-based load balancer will parse incoming HTTP requests and will look for the session ID of those requests in order to ensure all requests from the same session arrive at the same application server.

By default, this is done by examining the `jsessionid` HTTP cookie or GET parameter and looking for the `jvmRoute` assigned to the session.
The typical `jsessionid` value is of the form `<sessionId>.<jvmRoute>` . The very first request for each new HTTP session does not have a session ID assigned; the apache routes the request to a random application server node.

When the node responds it assigns a session ID and `jvmRoute` to the response of the request in a HTTP cookie.
This response goes back to the client through apache, which keeps track of which node owns each `jvmRoute` . Once the very first request is served this way, the subsequent requests from this session will carry the assigned cookie, and the apache load balancer will always route the requests to the node, which advertised itself as the `jvmRoute` owner.

Instead of using apache, an integrated HTTP Load Balancer is also available.
The Restcomm Load Balancer has a HTTP port where you can direct all incoming HTTP requests.
The integrated HTTP load balancer behaves exactly like apache by default, but this behavior is extensible and can be overridden completely with the pluggable balancer algorithms.
The integrated HTTP load balancer is much easier to configure and generally requires no effort, because it reuses most SIP settings and assumes reasonable default values.

Unlike the native apache, the integrated HTTP Load Balancer is written completely in Java, thus a performance penalty should be expected when using it.
However, the integrated HTTP Balancer has an advantage when related SIP and HTTP requests must stick to the same node.

== SMPP multiplexing basics

SMPP providers (e.g.NEXMO) offer limited numbers of connections to their services
but sometimes we need more than one client connections to it. So you can use our
load balancer as SMPP multiplexer for multiplexing connections from several clients
(Restcomm) to one SMPP provider using one connection.

When very first client connect to SMPP load balancer, Load balancer creates connection
to server and next clients reuse it. When connection to server established it can
be used in both directions (transceiver mode): ESME and SMSC can send messages
through the load balancer.

.SMPP load balancer diagram
image::images/SMPP-lb-diagram.png[]

Main goal is to reuse connection to the servers (SMSC) and simply transfer packets
between client (ESME) and server(SMSC). But also it can inspect the received packets
for correct command ID and will not send incorrect packets forward instead turn them back.

When connection to server drops, SMPP load balancer can reconnect (rebind) to the
server. During this process (reconnect) it turns back all received packets until
the new connection is established. If there are no established connection with
the server, all connections will be closed.

== Pluggable balancer algorithms

The SIP/HTTP Load Balancer exposes an interface to allow users to customize the routing decision making for special purposes.
By default there are three built-in algorithms.
Only one algorithm is active at any time and it is specified with the `algorithmClass`    property in the configuration file.

It is up to the algorithm how and whether to support distributed architecture or how to store the information needed for session affinity.
The algorithms will be called for every SIP and HTTP request and other significant events to make more informed decisions.

NOTE: Users must be aware that by default requests explicitly addressed to a live server node passing through the load balancer will be forwarded directly to the server node.
This allows for pre-specified routing use-cases, where the target node is known by the SIP client through other means.
If the target node is dead, then the node selection algorithm is used to route the request to an available node.

The following is a list of the built-in algorithms:



org.mobicents.tools.sip.balancer.CallIDAffinityBalancerAlgorithm::
  This algorithm is not distributable.
  It selects nodes randomly to serve a give Call-ID extracted from the requests and responses.
  It keeps a map with `Call-ID ->
              nodeId` associations and this map is not shared with other load balancers which will cause them to make different decisions.
  For HTTP it behaves like apache.

  org.mobicents.tools.sip.balancer.UserBasedAlgorithm::
    This algorithm algorithm tie all calls for a given DID/Number to the same node.
    All participants for a given conference will be on the same node.
    It selects nodes randomly to serve a give To header extracted from the requests and responses.
    It keeps a map with `To ->
                nodeId` associations and this map is not shared with other load balancers which will cause them to make different decisions.
    For HTTP it behaves like apache.

org.mobicents.tools.sip.balancer.HeaderConsistentHashBalancerAlgorithm::
  This algorithm is distributable and can be used in distributed load balancer configurations.
  It extracts the hash value of specific headers from SIP and HTTP messages to decide which application server node will handle the request.
  Information about the options in this algorithms is available in the balancer configuration file comments.

org.mobicents.tools.sip.balancer.PersistentConsistentHashBalancerAlgorithm::
  This algorithm is distributable and is similar to the previous algorithm, but it attempts to keep session affinity even when the cluster nodes are removed or added, which would normally cause hash values to point to different nodes.

org.mobicents.tools.sip.balancer.ClusterSubdomainAffinityAlgorithm::
  This algorithm is not distributable, but supports grouping server nodes to act as a subcluster.
  Any call of a node that belongs to a cluster group will be preferentially failed over to a node from the same group.
  To configure a group you can just add the `subclusterMap` property in the load balancer properties and listing the IP addresses of the nodes.
  The groups are enclosed in parentheses and the IP addresses are separate by commas as follows:
+
----
subclusterMap=( 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2 ) ( 10.10.10.10,20.20.20.20, 30.30.30.30)
----
+
The nodes specified in a group do not have to alive and nodes that are not specified are still allowed to join the cluster. Otherwise the algorthim behaves exactly as the default Call-ID affinity algorthim.

== Distributed load balancing

When the capacity of a single load balancer is exceeded, multiple load balancers can be used.
With the help of an IP load balancer the traffic can be distributed between all SIP/HTTP load balancers based on some IP rules or round-robin.
With consistent hash and `jvmRoute` -based balancer algorithms it doesn't matter which SIP/HTTP load balancer will process the request, because they would all make the same decisions based on information in the requests (headers, parameters or cookies) and the list of available nodes.
With consistent hash algorithms there is no state to be preserved in the SIP/HTTP balancers.

[[_sslb_sip_load_balancer_implementation]]
== Implementation of the {this-platform}  Load Balancer

Each individual {this-platform} SIP Server in the cluster is responsible for contacting the Restcomm Load Balancer and relaying its health status and regular "heartbeats".

From these health status reports and heartbeats, the Restcomm Load Balancer creates and maintains a list of all available and healthy nodes in the cluster.
The Load Balancer forwards SIP requests between these cluster nodes, providing that the provisioning algorithm reports that each node is healthy and is still sending heartbeats.

If an abnormality is detected, the Restcomm Load Balancer removes the unhealthy or unresponsive node from the list of available nodes.
In addition, mid-session and mid-call messages are failed over to a healthy node.

The Restcomm Load Balancer first receives SIP requests from endpoints on a port that is specified in its Configuration Properties configuration file.
The Restcomm Load Balancer, using a round-robin algorithm, then selects a node to which it forwards the SIP requests.
The Load Balancer forwards all same-session requests to the first node selected to initiate the session, providing that the node is healthy and available.

[[_sslb_smpp_load_balancer_implementation]]
== Implementation of the SMPP Load Balancer

SMPP load balancer implements timers: enquire link timer, session initialization timer and response timer for connection handling.
Timers of SMPP load balancer have next behaviour:

* Session initialization timer disconnects client (ESME) if it does not send bind request in defined time;
* Response timer sends response with system error if sender does not receive response in defined time;
* Enquire link timer with a fixed rate checks the connections with client (ESME) and server (SMSC).

Server part of SMPP load balancer has next states:

* OPEN - it can receive only bind requests from client (ESME);
* BINDING - it can't receive any messages, in this state we wait for client's response;
* BOUND - it can receive all PDU packets from client (ESME), which he can send according SMPP protocol, except bind requests;
* REBINDING - it can also receive all PDU packets from client (ESME), but returns them back, because the client part at this time is trying to reconnect to server;
* UNBINDING - it can receive only unbind response from client (ESME);
* CLOSED - it can't receive any messages, this is last state of life cycle, which indicate that connection is closed.

Client part of SMPP load balancer has next states:

* INITIAL - it can't receive any messages, this is first state of life cycle, at this state the client part is trying to connect to the server (SMSC) and if the connection is successful state changes to OPEN;
* OPEN - it can't receive any messages, at this state the client part sends a bind request to the server (SMSC), and changes state to binding;
* BINDING - it can receive only bind response from server, and if response does not have errors, the client part changes ones state to bound;
* BOUND - it can receive all packets from server (SMSC), which can be sent according SMPP protocol, except unbind response;
* REBINDING - if connection drops to the server (SMSC), the client part changes ones state to rebinding until reconnect.
  If reconnect fails, connection is closed;
* UNBINDING - it can receive unbind response from server only, after which state changes to closed state;
* CLOSED - it can't receive any messages, this is the last state of the life cycle, which indicates that the connection is closed.

== SIP Message Flow

The Restcomm Load Balancer appends itself to the `Via`    header of each request, so that returned responses are sent to the SIP Balancer before they are sent to the originating endpoint.

The Load Balancer also adds itself to the path of subsequent requests by adding Record-Route headers.
It can subsequently handle mid-call failover by forwarding requests to a different node in the cluster if the node that originally handled the request fails or becomes unavailable.
The Restcomm Load Balancer immediately fails over if it receives an unhealthy status, or irregular heartbeats from a node.

Additionally, Restcomm Load Balancer will add two custom header containing the initial remote address and port of the sip client for every REGISTER request or requests with content.

* X-Sip-Balancer-InitialRemoteAddr
* X-Sip-Balancer-InitialRemotePort

Application can use these two headers to have the correct location of the sip client that sent the REGISTER request.

In advanced configurations, it is possible to run more than one Restcomm Load Balancer.
Simply edit the balancers connection string in your SIP Server - the list is separated with semi-colon.

<<_figure_mss_basic_ip_and_port_cluster_configuration>>    describes a basic IP and Port Cluster Configuration.
In the diagram, the Restcomm Load Balancer is the server with the IP address of `192.168.1.1` .

== Using the Load Balancer with Third-Party SIP Servers

The load balancer only forwards requests to servers that send heartbeat signals.
A third party server can send metadata using a SIP OPTIONS or SIP INFO message towards the internal port of the Restcomm Load Balancer.
For security reasons heartbeat messages arriving at the external entry-point will be ignored and using a single internal and external entry-point is not allowed.
The third party SIP server must advertise it's metadata in the SIP message contents.

For example, this request will advertise a SIP server listening on 127.0.0.1:5070, both TCP and UDP .

[source]
----

Mobicents-Heartbeat: 1
Content-Length: 54

tcpPort=5070
udpPort=5070
hostname=sipHeartbeat
ip=127.0.0.1
----

The important headers to be filled in this request are `Mobicents-Heartbeat` , the Route header with `;node_host=127.0.0.1;node_port=5070` and the message contents.
The message contents are interpreted as properties of the `SIPNode` object representing the node in the load balancer and can be further interpreted by load balancing algorithms for load balancing purposes.
The value of the `Mobicents-Heartbeat` header is arbitrary and reserved for future use, the presence of the header is sufficient to instruct the load balancer how to process the request.

All requests initiated by the SIP Server must have the following hint in their Route header `;node_host=127.0.0.1;node_port=5070` . This hint instructs the Restcomm Load Balancer that the dialog initated by the application server must stay on the node advertised in the hint.
This function is cruicial when the direction of the requests withing the dialog is reversed.

Since this SIP request represents a heartbeat signal, it must be sent regularly at least once every 5 seconds (by default). Sending this request is responsibility of the third party server.
The load balancer will respond to every heartbeat request with 200 OK immediately.
The third party server must expect the OK response.
If no response if received within a threshhold time then the third party SIP server must assume the Restcomm Load Balancer is not available and use another (backup) load balancer.

The regular Restcomm Load Balancer setting are still in effect for third party servers and you can expect the same behavior as the Mobicents-specific RMI heartbeat configuration.

If you are desgning a pluggable algorithm using the SIP metadata, you can access the properties passed in the SIP message contents using `SIPNode.getProperties()`

== Configuring Load-balancer and two Restcomm servers on the one local machine

.Load balancer and Restcomm servers diagram
image::images/Restcomm_servers-LB.png[]

This chapter will show you how to configure two Restcomm instances and Load Balancer instance on one machine with OS Ubuntu.

.Step 0: Create three sub interfaces
Example for Ubuntu:

Restcomm-server1

root@ubuntu:~# ifconfig lo:1 127.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

Restcomm-server2

root@ubuntu:~# ifconfig lo:2 127.0.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.0

Load balancer

root@ubuntu:~# ifconfig lo:3 127.0.0.4 netmask 255.255.255.0

.Step 1: Install Mysql

Example for Ubuntu: https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/mysql/install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04

.Step 2: Download the latest version of Restcomm

. Download the latest version of Restcomm zip file from:
https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/

. Unzip the binary to a local directory. It should be similar to this Mobicents-Restcomm-JBoss-AS7-<version-number>.
We shall refer to this above Restcomm directory as the $RESTCOMM_HOME.

.Step 3: Configuring the mybatis.xml file to use Mysql

. Edit the file $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/conf/mybatis.xml
. Change the <environments default="production"> to  <environments default="mariadb">
. Add the MariaDB configuration environment tag as shown below

    <environment id="mariadb">
      <transactionManager type="JDBC"/>
      <dataSource type="POOLED">
        <property name="driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
        <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/restcomm"/>
        <property name="username" value="SQL_Login"/>
        <property name="password" value="SQL_Password"/>
      </dataSource>
    </environment>

. Save and exit the mybatis.xml file

.Step 4: Start Mysql and Create the restcomm Database

. Start mysql service if it is not already started  – sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
. Go to the directory $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/scripts/mariadb
. There will be an init.sql file and an sql directory
. Create the restcomm database from the init.sql as follows:

  mysql -u root -p < init.sql

. Log into mysql and make sure the restcomm database is created :  show databases

.Step 5: Edit the restcomm.xml file to point the DAO to mysql

. Edit the file $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/conf/restcomm.xml
. Find the dao-manager tag and change the sql-files path to mariadb as shown below

  <dao-manager class="org.mobicents.servlet.restcomm.dao.mybatis.MybatisDaoManager">
    <configuration-file>${restcomm:home}/WEB-INF/conf/mybatis.xml</configuration-file>
    <data-files></data-files>
    <sql-files>${restcomm:home}/WEB-INF/scripts/mariadb/sql</sql-files>
  </dao-manager>

.Step 6: Download Mysql Java Client Driver
. Download the latest mysql java connector client driver jar file from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java.
. Put jar file in $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/lib/

.Step 7: Download key store file for SSL

You can download file from
https://github.com/RestComm/load-balancer/blob/master/config-examples/keystore
(password 123456) or create independently and put this file
in package $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration/

.Step 8: Edit mss-sip-stack.properties file

. Edit the file $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration/mss-sip-stack.properties
. Add next lines to file

  org.mobicents.ha.javax.sip.BALANCERS=127.0.0.4:5082
  org.mobicents.ha.javax.sip.LOCAL_HTTP_PORT=8080
  org.mobicents.ha.javax.sip.LOCAL_SSL_PORT=8443
  org.mobicents.ha.javax.sip.REACHABLE_CHECK=false
  gov.nist.javax.sip.TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_TYPE=Disabled
  javax.net.ssl.keyStore=/absolutePathToKeystore/keystore
  javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=123456
  javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=123456
  javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolutePathToKeystore/keystore
  javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=JKS

.Step 9: Configure Restcomm IP information and Text-to-speech

. Go to the directory $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm
. Open the file restcomm.conf
. Go to the section # Network configuration

. Configure the following variables with the network configuration details of your first server.

  #Network configuration
  NET_INTERFACE='lo:1'
  PRIVATE_IP='127.0.0.2'
  SUBNET_MASK='255.255.255.0'
  NETWORK='127.0.0.0'
  BROADCAST_ADDRESS='127.0.0.255'

. Add next parameters for enabling https connector (password and alias for file from github example)

  #HTTPS Settings
  #File should be located at $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration folder.
  #Provide just the name of the trustore file. Leave it blank to disable HTTPS
  TRUSTSTORE_FILE='keystore'
  #Password for the trustore file
  TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD='123456'
  #The certificate alias
  TRUSTSTORE_ALIAS='smpp'
  #Control whether or not Restcomm will accept self-signed certificates.
  #Values allowall=allow #self-signed certificates,
  #strict=don't allow self signed certificates
  SSL_MODE='allowall'

. Add your VoiceRSS API key to the variable

  VOICERSS_KEY=‘f4840af6675b4d20a8d96dea8466296b‘

. Also edit next lines

  ACTIVATE_LB='TRUE'
  LB_ADDRESS='127.0.0.4'
  LB_INTERNAL_PORT='5082'
  LB_SIP_PORT_UDP='5080'
  LB_SIP_PORT_TCP='5080'
  LB_SIP_PORT_TLS='5081'
  LB_SIP_PORT_WS='5082'
  LB_SIP_PORT_WSS='5083'

. Save and exit the restcomm.conf file

.Step 10: Configure proxy.conf file

Change in $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/proxy.conf file next lines

  ACTIVE_PROXY='true'
  PROXY_IP='172.21.0.104'
  PROXY_PRIVATE_IP='127.0.0.4'

.Step 11: Configuration second Restcomm server

. Copy $RESTCOMM_HOME folder to separate folder and change next files there:
.. $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/restcomm.conf

  NET_INTERFACE='lo:2'
  PRIVATE_IP='127.0.0.3'

.. $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/start-restcomm.sh

Because we are going to start second Restcomm server on same machine,
we should change name of screen session "restcomm" to "restcomm2"
or something like that and name of screen session "mms" to "mms2".
Also we should add property -bmanagement=$bind_address, as shown below:

  if screen -list | grep -q 'restcomm2'; then
  echo 'TelScale RestComm is already running on screen session "restcomm2"!'
  ....
  echo 'TelScale RestComm started running on standalone mode. Screen session: restcomm2.'
  ....
  $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b $bind_address -bmanagement=$bind_address
  else
  screen -dmS 'restcomm2' $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b $bind_address -bmanagement=$bind_address
  ....
  screen -dmS 'restcomm2' $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/domain.sh -b $bind_address -bmanagement=$bind_address
  echo 'TelScale RestComm started running on domain mode. Screen session: restcomm2.'
  ....
  screen -dmS 'restcomm2' $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b $bind_address -bmanagement=$bind_address
  echo 'TelScale RestComm started running on standalone mode. Screen session: restcomm2.'
  ....
  if screen -ls | grep -q 'mms2'; then
  echo '...Mobicents Media Server is already running on screen session "mms2"!'
  else
  chmod +x $MMS_HOME/bin/run.sh
  screen -dmS 'mms2'  $MMS_HOME/bin/run.sh
  echo '...Mobicents Media Server started running on screen "mms2"!'

.. $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/stop-restcomm.sh

  if screen -ls | grep -q 'mms2'; then
  screen -S 'mms2' -p 0 -X 'quit'
  echo '...stopped Mobicents Media Server instance running on screen session "mms2"...'
  ....
  if screen -list | grep -q 'restcomm2'; then
  screen -S 'restcomm2' -p 0 -X 'quit'
  echo '...stopped RestComm instance running on screen session "restcomm2"!'

.Step 12: Start Restcomm servers and Open the Admin GUI

. Go to the directory Restcomm by running the $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/
. Run the command below to start Restcomm and the media server:

  ./start-restcomm.sh

. Open your web browser and go to the url – http://127.0.0.2:8080/
. Log in with the username=administrator@company.com and the password=RestComm
You will be prompted to change the default password.
. For stopping Restcomm run the command:

.Step 13: Download and configuring of Load Balancer

. Download last version of load balancer jar file from https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Restcomm-LoadBalancer/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/jar/target/sip-balancer-jar-x.x.xx-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
Where <x.x.xx> is the release version number
. Download configuration file for load balancer from https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Restcomm-LoadBalancer/ws/lb-configuration.properties
. Download log4g file for load balancer from https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Restcomm-LoadBalancer/ws/lb-log4j.xml
. Put this files in one folder
. Modify lb-configuration.properties file for correct work. Comment #host= line, and uncomment end set up next lines:

  externalHost=172.21.0.104
  externalWsPort=5090
  externalWssPort=5091
  internalHost=127.0.0.4
  internalWsPort=5082
  internalWssPort=5083

.Step 14: Use Olympus with Restcomm for WS and WSS

For adding certificate of Load balancer to your browser you should connect to it:

https://127.21.0.104:5091

and confirm certificate.

For WS:

Login to Restcomm server http://127.0.0.2:8080/olympus/
Fill in form: Load Balancer's ip adress (externalHost) 172.21.0.104 and port(externalWsPort) 5090

For WSS:

Login to Restcomm server https://127.0.0.2:8443/olympus/
Fill in form: Load Balancer's ip adress (externalHost) 172.21.0.104 and port (externalWssPort) 5091

== Integration Load Balancer SMPP with Restcomm and Nexmo

.Configure Restcomm to Use SMPP
First you need to configure the IP address and other features required
to start Restcomm as explained link:http://documentation.telestax.com/connect/configuration/Starting%20Restcomm-Connect.html#start-restcomm-connect[Starting Restcomm-Connect.]
Edit the file  $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/restcomm.conf You must set the SMPP_ACTIVATE variable to true for SMPP to be activated

 #Connection details for SMPP Restcomm integration
 SMPP_ACTIVATE='true' #Set to true to activate SMPP
 SMPP_SYSTEM_ID='xxxxx'  #your NEXMO “key”
 SMPP_PASSWORD='xxxxxx' #your NEXMO “secret”
 SMPP_SYSTEM_TYPE='xxxxxx'  #This is required when working with Nexmo for inbound SMS
 SMPP_PEER_IP='xxxxxx'  #smppHost of Load Balancer
 SMPP_PEER_PORT='xxxxx'  #smppPort of Load Balancer

.Configure Load Balancer to Use SMPP
Edit the file lb-configuration.properies

 # SMPP Load Balancer Settings
 smppName=SMPP Load Balancer
 # The address of the load balancer
 smppHost=xxxxxx
 # The port of the load balancer on which Restcomm connects
 smppPort=xxxx
 # The port of the load balancer for SSL protocol on which Restcomm connects
 #smppSslPort=xxxx
 # The IP address:port of Nexmo server
 remoteServers=174.37.245.38:8000
 # max number of connections/sessions this server will expect to handle
 # this number corrosponds to the number of worker threads handling reading
 # data from sockets and the thread things will be processed under
 # it is recommended that at any time there were no more than 10 (ten) SMPP
 # messages are outstanding (10 is default)
 #maxConnectionSize=10
 # Is NIO enabled (default true)
 #nonBlockingSocketsEnabled=true
 # Is default session counters enabled(used for testing)
 #defaultSessionCountersEnabled=true
 # Response timeout for load balancer in milliseconds (max time which LB wait
 # for response, after timeout packet сonsidered lost and send error response)
 timeoutResponse=10000
 # Session initialization timer(if client connect but doesn’t send bind
 # request then LB disconnects it)
 timeoutConnection=1000
 # Enquire Link Timer (after each this period LB checks connection to
 # client and server(sends enquire_link))
 timeoutEnquire=50000
 # Time between reconnection(time which LB wait for reconnection if connection
 # was lost)
 reconnectPeriod=1000
 # Connection check timer in load balancer (time which LB wait for
 # enquire_link_resp and if doesn’t receive, close connection to client)
 timeoutConnectionCheckClientSide=1000
 # Connection check server side timer(time which LB wait for
 # enquire_link_resp and if doesn’t receive, tries to rebind to server )
 timeoutConnectionCheckServerSide=1000

Start the Load balancer and Restcomm, in a few seconds connection should established
and you can see next line:

  INFO [MClientConnectionImpl] Connection to server : 127.0.0.1 : 10021 established. Server session ID : 0

Now you can send outbound and inbound messages. How to send messages you can find
